# Example API-calls to Inferencehub
This repository shows how you can use [Inferencehub](https://www.inferencehub.io) for inference on machine learning models. 
## Getting started
To get started you first need an account on [Inferencehub](https://www.inferencehub.io). If you have an account, you need to create an `.env`-file and specify your account credentials there.  
You can find an example on how the `.env`-file should look in `config/.env.sample`. You can just copy it and name it `config/.env`. After you inserted your account credentials you only need to install all dependencies and then you are all set up. You can install the dependencies using 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  
Now you can get started. Have fun!
